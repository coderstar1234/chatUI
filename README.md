<h1 align="center">Chatbot UI:-</h1>
This is a simple Chatbot User Interface project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Chatbot UI is designed to be used with a backend service that handles the logic of the chatbot, such as generating responses to user input.

<h1 align="center">Getting Started:-</h1>
To use the Chatbot UI, you'll need to have a backend service set up that can handle requests from the UI and generate responses. The backend service should accept POST requests with a JSON payload that includes the user's message and any additional information needed to generate a response.

Once you have your backend service set up, you can clone this repository and open the index.html file in your web browser. The Chatbot UI will load and display a simple chat interface where users can enter messages and receive responses from the backend service.

<h1 align="center">Customizing the UI:-</h1>
The Chatbot UI is built using simple HTML and CSS, so it's easy to customize and modify to fit your needs. You can modify the HTML and CSS files directly to change the appearance of the chat interface, or you can modify the JavaScript file to add additional functionality.
